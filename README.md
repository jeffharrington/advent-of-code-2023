# Advent of Code 2023
Solutions to [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023)

# Goal
My goal this year is to complete the solutions using [purely functional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purely_functional_programming) code in strict [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

# Running
You can run a day's exercise using the `bun` command like so:
```
bun day01/part1.ts
```
