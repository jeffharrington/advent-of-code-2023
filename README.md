# Advent of Code 2023

Solutions to [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023)

# Goal

My goal this year is to complete the solutions using [purely functional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purely_functional_programming) code in strict [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

# Running

You can run a day's exercise using the `bun` command like so:

```sh
bun day01/part1.ts
```

# Testing

If there are tests for a particular day, you can use `bun test` to run them like so:

```sh
bun test -t "day15/part1"
```
